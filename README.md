     - Groq API key (`GROQ_API_KEY` for AI analysis).
     - Google API key (`GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Google Generative AI Embeddings).

5. **Clerk Configuration:**

   - Sign up for [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and create a new application to get your Clerk keys.
   - Configure Clerk in your `.env` file with the keys obtained.

6. **External Services:**

   - Groq: Obtain an API key for Groq and set it in your `.env` file. You can get your Groq API key [here](https://wow.groq.com/).
   - Google Generative AI Embeddings: Ensure you have access and set the API key in `.env`. For Gemini API key, refer to [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/a_vuUufkCy4?si=EvX9I9eoUBDnf3df).

### Optional Dependencies

- If the project uses other external services or APIs, ensure you have the necessary keys and configurations set in `.env`.
